Some implications: \n* I used NSKeyedArchiver to persist trees locally.\n* All of a user's trees are loaded into memory at once.\n* No remote persistence.\n* Saving of data only happens when the app enters background or terminates."))

I've been using TDD more and more in the code I write, but for this app the most likely causes of bugs were in the UI (which is hard to write tests for until the UI actually exists). In hindsight, I wish I had written some simple UI test cases for basic interactions (adding / deleting / navigating between cells) once I had gotten those working."))
